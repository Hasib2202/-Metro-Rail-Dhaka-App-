### Background
Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, with a population exceeding 18 million, faces growing demands for efficient transportation services. The metro rail system has become a critical alternative to road-based travel. However, challenges remain in terms of real-time information and convenient ticket purchasing options, which are currently lacking. These issues often lead to missed trains, long waiting times, and inefficient journeys. 

Considering these issues, developing a mobile app dedicated to the Dhaka Metro Rail system has become essential. This app will provide real-time updates, streamline ticket purchasing, and improve the overall experience for commuters and tourists alike.

### Problem
Commuters in Dhaka face difficulties in accessing real-time information regarding metro services, leading to missed trains and wasted time. Additionally, ticket purchasing can be inconvenient, especially during peak hours and for tourists. This highlights the need for a mobile solution to provide up-to-date information and a seamless ticketing experience.
